Below is a collection of quotes and other bits and pieces that I collect as I read.

*We are not beggars hoping for scraps. We are like people who have inherited a vast estate: we have to study the documents and visit different locations because it’s more than we can take in at a single glance. In the same way, it takes considerable time and effort to begin to comprehend all that we have received in Christ. Theological thinking does not add a single thing to what we have received. The inheritance remains the same whether we grasp its magnitude or not. But the better we grasp it, the happier we are.*
— Myers, Benjamin (2018). The Apostles' Creed: A Guide to the Ancient Catechism.

*When it called God “maker of heaven and earth,” it parted company with Hinduism and Eastern faiths generally; now, by calling Jesus Christ God’s only Son, it parts company with Judaism and Islam and stands quite alone.*  
— J.I. Packer, Affirming the Apostles Creed, Chapter 6, Paragraph 1.
