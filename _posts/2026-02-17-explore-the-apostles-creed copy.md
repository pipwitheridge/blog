*February 2026*

Below is the scaffolding of a 3-week evangelistic course based on the Apostles' Creed.

# Week 1: Belief in God

• Introductory / get-to-know-you question: have you ever gone on a journey?
• Introduction to exploring: two kinds of maps (large-scale—large amount of detail, small area vs. small-scale—small amount of detail, large area; similar to studying Bible and the Creed) – could include both map types on the screen as an example.
• Course overview (3 week preview)
• Introduction to the Apostles' Creed
• who were the apostles?
• when/how was the creed written? by whom? why?
• Read the Apostles' Creed
• Focusing in on words "I believe in God" - creed = belief
• "I" is significant; it's a personal faith, not simply defined by culture or upbringing.
• "Believe in" need unpacking. It's not like saying "I believe in UFOs" or "I believe in democracy"... it's more like saying "I have faith in my car."
• "God" needs unpacking. It's not any God; it's a particular God. It's not an absent God; it's a loving God. It's not an impotent God; it's an omnipotent God. It is not a man-made God; man cannot fully grasp God (nor should we expect to).
• Possible verses to explore about faith/belief: Romans 4, Hebrews 11, Mark 5:25-;34
• Possible verses to explore about God's character: Exodus 34:6-7
• Weighing up belief in God verses agnosticism and atheism
— traditional arguments against God
— traditional arguments for God
• "creator of heaven and earth" ... Gen 1 & 2, their main aim is to tell us not how the world was made but who made it.
• Apostles' creed doesn't give those arguments
• Spiritual claims & historical claims
• Spiritual claim = Jesus entered this world by a miracle; he left this world by a miracle. Cf. Isa 7:14 (virgin birth) and Isa 53:10-12 (resurrection-ascension).
• Spiritual and historical claims meet in the crucifixion. Both God and men were agents of Jesus’ passion: “this Jesus, delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men” (Acts 2:23, from Peter’s first sermon).
• Christianity hinges on historical claims
• Jesus' death and resurrection in history

— Biblical Quote (Luke 1:1–4; 1 John 1:1-2)

# Week 2: Father, Son, Spirit

• Introductory / get-to-know-you question: three words to describe yourself
• Course overview
• Read the Apostles' Creed
• Focusing on 3 words, Father, Son and Spirit
• Father = provider; we are dependant on God for everything, including our existence
• Jesus prays to his Father and promising that he and his Father would send “another Helper” (John 14:16)
• Salvation scheme: the Father planning, the Son procuring, and the Spirit applying redemption. See Romans 8:1-17; 2 Corinthians 13:14; Ephesians 1:3-14; 2 Thessalonians 2:13ff.; 1 Peter 1:2.
• Verses explaining God as Father
• the Father loves the Son (John 3:35; 5:20) and makes him great by giving him glory and great things to do (5:20-30; 10:17ff.; 17:23-26).
• “To all who did receive him (Jesus), who believed in his name, he gave power to become children of God, who were born... of God” (John 1:12ff.).
• "Almighty" - he can and will do all that he intends.
• *Whatever the Lord pleases, he does, in heaven and on earth, in the seas and all deeps.* Psalm 135:6.
• This doesn't negate human choices and responsibility.
• Verses showing Jesus as son
• “No one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him” (Matthew 11:27).
• the Son loves the Father (John 14:31) and always does what pleases the Father (8:29).
• God “did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all” (Romans 8:32): that was the measure of his love (cf. Romans 5:5-8)
• Verses showing Spirit as distinct
• Trinity: not three seperate Gods, trinity. And yet, trinity blows our mind.
• Missions of God: The Father send the Son; the Father and the Son sent the Spirit
• The Father made me; the Son saved me; the Spirit changes me
• What this means for Christian living: we can know God the Father, we can change
• Interview: how has life changed since becoming a Christian?
• Other relevant verses for this week: John 1:1–18, "Have we not all one Father? Has not one God created us?" Malachi 2:10

# Week 3: Forgiveness, Resurrection, Life

• Introductory / get-to-know-you question
• Course overview
• Read the Apostles' Creed
• Focusing on 3 words, Forgiveness, Resurrection, Life
• *For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit.* 1 Peter 3:18.
• Story of forgiveness (parable of different debts)
• Story of resurrection ()
• What does "life everlasting" mean? Eschatology summary
