# Week 1: Belief in God

#### An introduction to exploring Christianity

• Introduction / get-to-know-you question: have you ever been on a journey?

• There are two kinds of maps: a large-scale map that has lots of detail of a small area, and a small-scale map that has a small amount of detail but covers a large area. Both maps are highly valuable depending on your goal. Reading the Bible is like reading through a collection of large-scale maps—it takes a long time but you get more detail as you go.

• A summary of Christianity is like a small-scale map: it seeks to cover a large area but only with a small amount of detail.

• Course overview:
— Week 1. Belief in God
— Week 2. Father, Son, Spirit
— Week 3. Life Everlasting

#### An introduction to the Apostles' Creed

• One famous summary of Christian beliefs can be found in the Apostles' Creed.

• Who were the Apostles? An apostle is someone sent on a mission, often with a message to deliver. When Christians talk about "the Apostles", we're referring to those who Jesus sent out after his resurrection with the mission of spreading the message of his resurrection to the world.

• What is a creed? The word "creed" comes from the Latin "credo" which means "belief".

• What is the Apostles' Creed? It is a summary statement of what Jesus' Apostles believed and taught. It was not written by the Apostles; we don't know exactly who wrote it. All we know is that it was written by Christians in the first few centuries of the church to summarise the Christian faith—they used it to teach others what they believed and they recited it to remind one another about their core beliefs.

• It reads as follows:
*I believe in God, the Father almighty,
creator of heaven and earth.
I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord,
who was conceived by the Holy Spirit
and born of the virgin Mary.
He suffered under Pontius Pilate,
was crucified, died, and was buried;
he descended to hell.
The third day he rose again from the dead.
He ascended to heaven
and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty.
From there he will come to judge the living and the dead.
I believe in the Holy Spirit,
the holy catholic church,
the communion of saints,
the forgiveness of sins,
the resurrection of the body,
and the life everlasting. Amen.*

• In week 1 we will focus on exploring the words "I believe in God".

#### "I"

• "I" is significant. Some people think that all people in the West are basically Christian. Some people think they are Christians because they went to a certain school or were baptised as babies or because their parents were Christians. But to be a Christian is to have a personal trust in God, not simply defined by culture or upbringing.

#### "believe in"

• "Believe in" need unpacking. It's not like saying "I believe in UFOs" – i.e. it is not simply saying that you believe God exists. It's not like saying "I believe in democracy" – i.e. that belief in God is a good idea that benefits society. It's more like saying "I believe in my car" right before you embark on a long trip. You entrust your livelihood to the reliability of the car. To believe in God is to entrust your life to Him.

• One verse that highlights what faith is about is Romans 4:21. It's describing a man who lived his life with faith, and it says he acted in faith "being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised." Now—this is man whose faith was incredibly strong, and it's what we aim for as Christians, though there is such thing as "weak" faith as well. As Christians our faith is not always perfect, but we try to grow in our faith in God.

#### "God"

• The word "God" needs explaining. But first, it is worth acknowledging that for many people, even thinking about the idea of God is difficult because there are objections, or mental barriers, that need addressing.

• One objection to Christianity is that science disproves God. However, this is a misunderstanding of what science can and can't do. Science can give us a detailed description of the universe and how it works, but it cannot give us an explanation for why the universe exists to begin with. Science is about making observations about how the natural world behaves. It takes faith to say that the natural world always behaves consistently, and it takes faith to say that the natural world is all there is. You can believe in the usefulness of science and believe in God—in fact, most Christians do.

• One objection to Christianity is that to claim to know anything about God is arrogant. However, Christians only claim to know anything about God because we believe God has revealed himself to people. How? In history, through events in the Old Testament and in the events of the New Testament. We believe God has most clearly revealed himself through the person of Jesus—his life, death and resurrection.

• One verse that highlights this idea is John 1:18: "No one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, who is himself God and is in closest relationship with the Father, has made him known."

• One objection to Christianity is that all gods are the same. However, the Christian believes that God has revealed himself to humanity through the person of Jesus, and in particular his life, death and resurrection. Jews don't believe Jesus is God—they believe he died but didn't rise. Muslims don't believe Jesus is God—they believe he was a prophet, and didn't die on the cross. Buddhist belief doesn't really focus on God, and it doesn't really touch on Jesus. Hindu belief can include multiple gods, and does not touch on Jesus. If Jesus is God, and the path to knowing God is by understanding Jesus' death and resurrection, it is ignorant to say that all the major religions are the same.

• So, what kind of God do Christians believe in? One passage that explores God's character is Exodus 34:6-7: "[God is a] compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness, maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished."

• This is a spiritual claim about who God is. Some people become Christians because these spiritual claims resonate with them. Some people become Christians because they would much rather live in a universe where there is a God than one in which we are alone with no hope beyond death. Some people become Christians because they enjoy the community of Christians and so choose to commit to the Christian worldview. But for those who are sceptical, there is another reason to believe—Jesus was real, he really died, and there is good evidence to suggest he really rose. That is, the spiritual claims of Christianity are tenable because we can investigate the history on which they sit.

• A verse which highlights this connection between the spiritual and the historical claims of Christianity comes in Romans 4:25: "He was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification."

• The historical claims are there to be investigated: he was delivered over to death, he was raised to life.

• The spiritual claims are there to be contemplated: he did this *for our sins* and *for our justification*.

• Reflection questionfor discussion: *what questions would you like to explore?*

# Week 2: Father, Son, Spirit

• Introductory / get-to-know-you question: three words to describe yourself
• Course overview
• Read the Apostles' Creed
• Focusing on 3 words, Father, Son and Spirit
• Father = provider; we are dependant on God for everything, including our existence
• Jesus prays to his Father and promising that he and his Father would send “another Helper” (John 14:16)
• Salvation scheme: the Father planning, the Son procuring, and the Spirit applying redemption. See Romans 8:1-17; 2 Corinthians 13:14; Ephesians 1:3-14; 2 Thessalonians 2:13ff.; 1 Peter 1:2.
• Verses explaining God as Father
• the Father loves the Son (John 3:35; 5:20) and makes him great by giving him glory and great things to do (5:20-30; 10:17ff.; 17:23-26).
• “To all who did receive him (Jesus), who believed in his name, he gave power to become children of God, who were born... of God” (John 1:12ff.).
• "Almighty" - he can and will do all that he intends.
• *Whatever the Lord pleases, he does, in heaven and on earth, in the seas and all deeps.* Psalm 135:6.
• This doesn't negate human choices and responsibility.
• Verses showing Jesus as son
• “No one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him” (Matthew 11:27).
• the Son loves the Father (John 14:31) and always does what pleases the Father (8:29).
• God “did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all” (Romans 8:32): that was the measure of his love (cf. Romans 5:5-8)
• Verses showing Spirit as distinct
• Trinity: not three seperate Gods, trinity. And yet, trinity blows our mind.
• Missions of God: The Father send the Son; the Father and the Son sent the Spirit
• The Father made me; the Son saved me; the Spirit changes me
• What this means for Christian living: we can know God the Father, we can change
