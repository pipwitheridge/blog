title: "The Challenge of Mark 8–16 for Young Adults"
---

*January 2026*

In the first half of Mark's gospel, the central question driving the entire narrative is "who is this man?" In Mark 8, Peter answers that question: "You are the Messiah." The rest of the gospel is about finding out what it means that Jesus is the Messiah.

Here I want to outline some key passages and cutting questions that may be useful for young adults studying the second half of Mark's gospel.

#### Mark 10:13–31

1. The rich man wants Jesus without letting go of his riches. What is something you struggle to let go of to follow Jesus?

2. What do we gain in this present age by following Jesus, according to verses 29–30?

3. How does our culture measure a person's worth in their twenties? How does this compare to how Jesus measures a person's worth?

#### Mark 10:13–52

1. How does our society measure a person's worth at a) work, b) uni, c) online? How does this compare to how Jesus measures a person's worth?

2. The rich man wants Jesus without letting go. What are some things people your age commonly struggle to release control over?

3. Bartimaeus knows what he wants and asks boldly. What might it look like for you to be honest with Jesus about what you really want right now?

#### Mark 11:1–12:12

1. If Jesus walked into your life like he walks into Jerusalem — what “tables” would he flip first?  
   *Be specific: what patterns, priorities, spending, relationships, habits, or ambitions would he call out as performative religion / hollow success?*

2. If Jesus walked into your church like he walks into Jerusalem — what “tables” would he flip first?

3. In the parable of the tenants, they want the vineyard without the owner. Where do you want the benefits of God (meaning, comfort, moral order, community) without God having authority?

#### Mark 12:13–40

1. Why do political, cultural, or ethical debates feel so emotionally charged right now?

2. Put yourself in the shoes of a friend or family member who doesn't believe in the resurrection. If there is no resurrection, what do you think gives life long-term meaning?

3a. Take 10 minutes and write down in list-form everything you've done in the past 24 hours. Once this is done, put a mark next to all the things you think you did that were not motivated by love of God or love of neighbour.

3b. Loving God and neighbour sounds ideal, but it's hard. Are there obvious opportunities to love God or neighbour that you're not currently taking?

#### Mark 13

1. What uncertainties cause the most anxiety for young adults right now — career, housing, relationships, global instability?

2. How do people try to manage uncertainty today — productivity, planning, self-improvement, distractions?

3. What’s the difference between being alert about the future and being consumed by it?

4. What secular hopes exist for the future? How do these compare to gospel hope?

#### Mark 14:1–6

The woman’s act looks excessive. What kinds of commitments would our culture label as “too much”?

Why do people often admire radical commitment in theory but resist it personally?

Judas stays close to Jesus while drifting internally. What might quiet disengagement from faith look like today?

Is sacrificial love ultimately sustainable — or does it always get exploited?

#### Mark 14:27–72

Where do you feel pressure to present a confident, together version of yourself — even when it’s not true?

Peter’s failure happens under social pressure. Where are you most tempted to stay quiet about your beliefs or values?

If Christianity is true, why are its key leaders so flawed?

#### Mark 14:27–72

Spend 10 minutes alone writing down what Jesus' death means for you personally. Share these with others.

Spend 10 minutes alone writing down what Jesus' resurrection means for you personally. Share these with others.
