title: "The Challenge of Mark 8–16 for Young Adults"
---

*January 2026*

In the first half of Mark's gospel, the central question driving the entire narrative is "who is this man?" In Mark 8, Peter answers that question: "You are the Messiah." The rest of the gospel is about finding out what it means that Jesus is the Messiah.

Here I want to outline some key passages and cutting questions that may be useful for young adults studying the second half of Mark's gospel.

#### Mark 10:13–31

1. The rich man wants Jesus without letting go of his riches. What is something you struggle to let go of to follow Jesus?

2. What do we gain in this present age by following Jesus, according to verses 29–30?

3. How does our culture measure a person's worth in their twenties? How does this compare to how Jesus measures a person's worth?

#### Mark 10.32-52

1. What would your life in your late teens and early twenties need to look like for the people around you at work/uni to consider your life to be "great"?

2. Imagine you tried to become a "servant of all" for one year. What would that look like? What about your life would change?

3. What practical steps can you take in your life now to become great (as defined by Jesus)?
