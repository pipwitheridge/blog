# A blessing and a curse
## Mark 11:1–12:12

## Jesus' arrival is a blessing for the faithful

There's a prophecy in the Bible about Jesus arriving at the epicenter of worship, the temple, and bringing about salvation for those who are faithful and destruction for those who are fruitless. I'm not talking about an Old Testament prophecy about Jesus' arrival in Mark 11; I'm talking about a New Testament prophecy about Jesus' second coming. It's in Revelation: *"There before me was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language ... holding palm branches in their hands."* — Revelation 7:9

Christians believe Jesus is returning to his people, to his temple, the church. It could happen any time—we don't know when. We don't know exactly how it will happen—we just believe it will happen, because Jesus promised he would return. But as we study Jesus' arrival to Jerusalem in Mark's gospel, I'd love us to have in mind the arrival we anticipate in Jesus' second coming.

If Jesus returned tonight—would you consider it a blessing or a curse? It depends, doesn't it? It depends on if you're ready—it depends on if you've lived as a faithful, fruitful follower of Jesus.

Jonothan Edwards was a puritan preacher in the 18th Century whose preaching lit up the world and caused many people to come to Christ. In his late teens and early twenties he wrote a list of resolutions that he would live by for the rest of his life. One of those resolutions read as follows: *"Resolved never to do anything I would be afraid to do if I knew the last trumpet would sound within the hour."* – Jonathan Edwards, Resolution 19.

How would your life change if you lived with a constant awareness of Jesus' arrival—if you expected Jesus to arrive within the hour, what would you be doing with your life now?

Those who were faithful to God in the time of Jesus anticipated the arrival of a king. The prophets throughout the Old Testament had predicted a Messiah, a Christ, a chosen king to arrive to Jerusalem to save Israel from destruction.

Zechariah prophesied this when he said:
*“Rejoice greatly, Daughter Zion!
Shout, Daughter Jerusalem!
See, your king comes to you,
righteous and victorious,
lowly and riding on a donkey,
on a colt, the foal of a donkey.”*
— Zechariah 9:9

The king would come not on a warhorse but on a donkey. It's possible we get the image here wrong much of the time. We think the donkey is what makes him lowly; we imagine him riding Eeyore from Winnie the Pooh or Donkey from Shrek. In reality, the donkey is a symbol of strength. In the Old Testament, the kings had donkeys. King David rode a donkey (2 Sam 13:29), Solomon rides a donkey to his anointing as king (1 Kings 1:33). Jesus is aligning himself with these exalted kings as he rides into Jeruslem. A horse represents going to battle; a donkey represents having won the battle. The shock of Zechariah 9:9 is that this king would be "lowly". Jesus has the crowds buzzing for him—in what sense is he lowly? He's lowly because though he rides into Jerusalm on the back of a donkey, he knows that in a few days time he'll be walked out of Jerusalem with a cross on his back.

This is why Jesus' arrival is a blessing for the faithful.

Jesus has been demonstrating his being from God all throughout Mark's gospel, and now the king of Israel arrives in the epicentre of the kingdom. Jesus arrives in Jerusalem and is treated like the king he is. Faithful followers recognise Jesus' arrival as a blessing. Let's read Mark 11 verses 9–10:

*Those who went ahead and those who followed shouted,
“Hosanna!”
“Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!”
“Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David!”
“Hosanna in the highest heaven!”*
— Mark 11:9–10

Some people at this point would be quick to point out that another crowd a few days later won't be yelling "Hosanna", but "crucify him!" It's important to say though that there were faithful people who followed Jesus and for whom Jesus' coming was a blessing.

Let me ask you this: if Jesus returned tonight, would you welcome him like this? Would you count it a blessing, or an inconvenience?

## Jesus arrives and issues a curse against the fruitless

Jesus arrival is a blessing for God's people, and part of the way Jesus blesses God's people is by overturning fruitless, fake temple worship.

But not before he curses a fig tree:

*"Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to find out if it had any fruit. When he reached it, he found nothing but leaves, because it was not the season for figs. Then he said to the tree, “May no one ever eat fruit from you again.”* – Mark 11:13–14

Nothing in the way Mark writes his gospel is by accident. Mark is very intentional about the stories he puts together. If you ever think something you are reading in Mark's gospel is strange, it could be that what you're reading serves as a living parable for something that's about to happen next. Let me give you one example—we read about the blind man whom Jesus healed by spitting and rubbing mud in his eye. The man could see, but his vision was still blurred—he could see people but they looked like trees. It took a second go to give him clear vision. This story came right before the story of the apostle Peter who had this moment of clarity: he recognised Jesus as the messiah. And yet his vision of Jesus was still a bit blurred because he did not understand Jesus' mission to die on the cross. It took longer for him to get clearer vision.

In our passage, Jesus curses a fig tree, which is weird. Why curse a fig tree? Because it wasn't bearing fruit! But it's not the right season for it to bear fruit, I hear you say as you look at verse 13. How is it fair for Jesus to curse a fig tree when it's not the season for figs? Did you notice that? Now I've read some commentators who want to say that it was the season for figs because Jesus saw the leaves and therefore you'd expect small buds of fruit to be there—a sort of pre-season snack. The tree had the external signs that fruit might be there, but there wasn't, just as the temple had externalities of worship with no real substance. I think that's part of it.

But I don't think that's all that the text leads us to think—it says it was not the season for figs. I think it has to do with how parables often work.

There's often a pattern that says, "If this example is true, how much more is the reality true!" Jesus once told a parable about prayer where he said if imperfect human fathers know how to give good gifts to their children, how much more will God give good things to those who ask him.

Similarly, if Jesus curses a tree for not bearing fruit when it is not in season, how much more will he curse a tree for not bearing fruit when it is in season. How much more will he curse the fruitless, faithless, fakers in the temple when they have been given every opportunity by God to bear the fruit of proper worship to Him!

For centuries the temple had endured foreign invaders, wars, decay and destruction. It had been rebuilt and reestablished to help God's people in God's place serve their God. It was supposed to be a place of hope; a place of reverence. It was supposed to be a place where vulnerable people prayed to God; instead it became a place where evil people preyed on the vulnerable. Notice what Jesus does:

*"Jesus entered the temple courts and began driving out those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves."* — Mark 11:15.

Jesus is angry, but his anger is totally justified. This is righteous anger. What is he angry about? Is it simply that there are things for sale amongst the people of God? If Jesus was here tonight would he tear down our church bookstall?

I don't think so. Notice who is singled out in the temple: those extorting others for profit—money changers and those selling doves. What's wrong with money changers? They were people who would help people exchange their currency for local currency to purchase things in the temple. Who here has ever been to a currency exchange booth at the airport? Are these people motivated by mercy and helping the poor? No—they're motivated by money and profit. There was an opportunity for money to be made, and they took it. What's wrong with those selling doves? In the Old Testament law, it says that you should sacrifice particular animals in the temple, but for the poorest of the poor who couldn't afford lambs or bulls or goats, they could sacrifice a small, cheap animal—doves. But people saw this as a money-making opportunity to rip off the poor. There are those I see walking around collecting cans and bottles in the streets, presumably to redeem them for 10 cents each. What would you think of me if I starting a business going around picking up all the cans I could and selling them to the poor for 9 cents each? I get 9 cents, they get 1 cent, I rip them off. You would think me an evil person out for profit. Now I don't know how these dove-sellers got their doves, but I imagine they went around with cages collecting them in the streets. An evil business. People should have recognised it as anti-God, yet they didn't! It's incredible how these things can go unchallenged.

I heard a story of a televangelist who had lured in a widow with very little social connection and very little cash, and he convinced her to give him and his "ministry" the last of what she had. This stuff still happens today and it makes God angry. The apostle Peter says "darkest darkness is reserved for them".

The challenge for us, of course, is to examine our own hearts and ask—do our external acts of worship reflect what's going on inside us? Whose glory are we motivated by when we come to God's temple—ours or God's? Whose gain do we seek?

Jesus' curse is actually a blessing for the most vulnerable. Because by overturning the tables Jesus overturns an oppressive system. And he shows that true worship is not bound to a temple—true worship can happen wherever there is true faith. It can happen by yourself in your room as you pray to God, it can happen when we sing praises in someone's backyard, it can happen anywhere where there are people who trust God.

This is Jesus' point to Peter.Peter is shocked that Jesus' prayed worked—he cursed the fig tree and it withered.

*“Have faith in God,” Jesus answered.* – Mark 11:22

Jesus says to him that God honours true faith wherever it is found—you can pray big prayers expecting God to answer, and He will.

## Jesus' opponents question his status as king

Those who are threatened by Jesus' lordship cloak their fear in a question.

*“By what authority are you doing these things?” they asked. “And who gave you authority to do this?”* – Mark 11:28

What right does Jesus have to come to Jerusalem and act like the king? Now, we might not have ever asked that particular question before. But the question behind the question is one we ask deep in our souls everytime we have to weigh up following Jesus or ignoring him. And that question is: what right does Jesus have to rule my life?

## Jesus questions his opponents' status in the kingdom

The real question we must ask is: if we reject the ruler of life, what are the consequences?

The answer is: the consequences are utterly dire, unless we realise why Jesus went to Jerusalem. He went to die for us.


# NOTES

11.30. Question: when it says "John's Baptism", is it talking about the baptism John gave Jesus, or the baptism John gave everyone, or the baptism John himself received?

11.32. "They feared the people" is perhaps the perfect way to describe everything wrong about the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders.

12.1-5. Like the story of the fig tree, proper "fruit" is what's on view here. In the Old Testament, the people did not produce the fruit of righteousness in response to the prophets sent by God, instead they harmed them. They will do the same to Jesus.

12.12. Similarly to 11.32, the key characteristic to be aware of here is their fear of the people: "they were afraid of the crowd".



Is there an area of your life where Jesus would flip things upside down? One of mine is faithfulness in prayer, which is exactly what he addressed with Peter

Crazy how one moment people can be praising Jesus, the next moment ignoring or deserting him. Hypocrisy is poison—beware.

Tie temple scene with us being temple of the holy spirit. Temple was supposed to be a place of prayer, devotion, sacrifice, worship — instead it was a place of greed, self-centredness, self-worship … what about you — do you not know your a God’s temple?

One of the first commands at the start of the Bible is the command to be fruitful. One of the first commands at the start of the New Testament is the command to be fruitful :Produce fruit in keeping with repentance. - Matthew 3:8

Can selling analogy – dove sellers are like rich people who go into the streets and collect cans and sell to those who are poor for 9c for profit's sake.

Airport exchange analogy – it's an opportunity to rort people, and they take it! The temple is supposed to be a place centred around mercy; they've made it a place centred around money. It's supposed to be a place focused on prayer; they've focused instead on profit.

Realise that as Jesus as telling the parable of the vineyard, HE IS THE SON WHO IS KILLED—and he knows it! Imagine the self-restraint, the humility, the sacrificial love

"Fig tree not in season" how is that fair? Look up commentaries. But I think – similar to parables that end in... if X is so, then how much more is Y so... (father prayer one). Imagine – if Jesus curses a tree when it's not supposed to bear fruit, how much more iwll he curse the temple when it is supposed to .

Jesus curses more fully in Mark 13. 70AD comes true.

What does Jesus mean when you ask anything in prayer you will receive it? That's not true surely?

Analogy - person who rents out their vineyard and eventually returns, compare to Soph and I having to move our caus owners want to sell - imagine if we killed the estate agent

End with: Rev 1:7 - “Look, he is coming with the clouds,”
    and “every eye will see him,
even those who pierced him”;
    and all peoples on earth “will mourn because of him.”
So shall it be! Amen.

Rev 2:4 - Yet I hold this against you: You have forsaken the love you had at first.

Rev 3:15 - 15 I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either one or the other! 16 So, because you are lukewarm—neither hot nor cold—I am about to spit you out of my mouth. 1

Jesus himself will bear the curse for us (1 Peter). He will experience being put on the outer for our sake.
