# A blessing and a curse
## Mark 11:1–12:12

### A blessing

Introductory question: if Jesus returned tonight—would you consider it a blessing or a curse? It depends, doesn't it? It depends on if you're ready, it depends on if you're faithful, it depends on if you're fruitful.

Jesus' arrival is considered a blessing. He arrives in the likeness of king david—and the hope is he'll be like king David.

### A curse

Jesus curses the fruitless fig tree as a sign of the coming curse against the fruitless temple.

Jesus exposes the hypocricy of performative religion. He sees through our greed and self-centredness.

The temple was supposed to be a place where vulnerable people prayed to God; it became a place where people preyed on the vulnerable.

Jesus' curse is actually a blessing for the most vulnerable.

True faith leads to prayer—weak faith leads to prayerlessness.

### A question

Those who are threatened by Jesus' lordship cloak their fear in a question—what right does Jesus have to rule my life?

### *The* question

The real question we must ask is: if we reject the ruler of life, what are the consequences?

The answer is: the consequences are utterly dire, unless we realise why Jesus went to Jerusalem. He went to die for us.


# NOTES

11.1–7. This ties to a prophecy, "your king is coming to you; righteous and having salvation is he, humble and mounted on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey." (Zechariah 9:9). It's possible we get the image here wrong much of the time. We think the donkey is what makes him lowly; we imagine him riding Eeyore from Winnie the Pooh or Donkey from Shrek. In reality, the donkey is a symbol of strength. The rich had donkeys (Judges 5:10), King David rode a donkey (2 Sam 13:29), Solomon rides a donkey to his anointing as king (1 Kings 1:33). Jesus is aligning himself with these exalted kings as he rides into Jeruslem. A horse represents going to battle; a donkey represents having won the battle. The shock of Zechariah 9:9 is that this king would be "lowly". Jesus has the crowds buzzing for him—in what sense is he lowly? He's lowly because though he rides into Jerusalm on the back of a donkey, he knows that in a few days time he'll be walked out of Jerusalem with a cross on his back.

It is perhaps worth reading Zech 9:9–13:
9 Rejoice greatly, Daughter Zion!
    Shout, Daughter Jerusalem!
See, your king comes to you,
    righteous and victorious,
lowly and riding on a donkey,
    on a colt, the foal of a donkey.
10 I will take away the chariots from Ephraim
    and the warhorses from Jerusalem,
    and the battle bow will be broken.
He will proclaim peace to the nations.
    His rule will extend from sea to sea
    and from the River to the ends of the earth.
11 As for you, because of the blood of my covenant with you,
    I will free your prisoners from the waterless pit.
12 Return to your fortress, you prisoners of hope;
    even now I announce that I will restore twice as much to you.
13 I will bend Judah as I bend my bow
    and fill it with Ephraim.
I will rouse your sons, Zion,
    against your sons, Greece,
    and make you like a warrior’s sword.

11.8-10. This is a beautiful scene until one realises what is to follow. The same lips that praise Jesus later shout "Crucify him! Crucify him!"


11.12–20. Nothing about Mark's gospel is lazy or unintentional. The way Mark pieces the narrative together is important. We see this in the story of the blind man whose vision becomes blury before it becomes clear, right before Peter's spiritual vision goes from dark to blury in his acknowledgement of Jesus as Messiah; clarity was yet to come. In this section, the fig tree doesn't bear the fruit Jesus wanted it to, and so it was accursed; the temple was not bearing the fruit God wanted it to, and so it would be accursed; we see this continuation in chapter 13.

11.15–17. Turning worship into a money-making scheme is evil, and the watching world knows it. There are many online who turn the church into a business to sell a product.


11.22–25. Faith will be rewarded, whether in the temple or not.

11.30. Question: when it says "John's Baptism", is it talking about the baptism John gave Jesus, or the baptism John gave everyone, or the baptism John himself received?

11.32. "They feared the people" is perhaps the perfect way to describe everything wrong about the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders.

12.1-5. Like the story of the fig tree, proper "fruit" is what's on view here. In the Old Testament, the people did not produce the fruit of righteousness in response to the prophets sent by God, instead they harmed them. They will do the same to Jesus.

12.12. Similarly to 11.32, the key characteristic to be aware of here is their fear of the people: "they were afraid of the crowd".



Is there an area of your life where Jesus would flip things upside down? One of mine is faithfulness in prayer, which is exactly what he addressed with Peter

Crazy how one moment people can be praising Jesus, the next moment ignoring or deserting him. Hypocrisy is poison—beware.

Tie temple scene with us being temple of the holy spirit. Temple was supposed to be a place of prayer, devotion, sacrifice, worship — instead it was a place of greed, self-centredness, self-worship … what about you — do you not know your a God’s temple?

One of the first commands at the start of the Bible is the command to be fruitful. One of the first commands at the start of the New Testament is the command to be fruitful :Produce fruit in keeping with repentance. - Matthew 3:8
