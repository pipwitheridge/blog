title: "Living With Predestination"
---

*December 2025*

Imagine a woman enters a shopping mall, pulls out a gun and shoots the first person she sees. She is guilty of a serious crime.

But what if other forces controlled her actions? What if, for example, someone had threatened to kill her family unless she did it? Or what if she was hypnotised into doing it? Or what if someone stronger than her marched her into the mall, forced her hand on the gun and pressed her finger down on the trigger so that it fired? In all these cases it seems that her guilt is mitigated by the forces controlling her.

How can she be held responsible if she is not in control of her actions?

I meet a lot of people who have a similar question about Christianity. It’s the predestination question. The question is basically this: if God controls everything, including us, why does he hold people responsible for anything?

The Bible makes it clear that God is in control, and that humans are responsible for their actions. A powerful example of this comes when Peter is preaching to the crowds at Pentecost, explaining to them what had happened to Jesus only a few weeks earlier. He says, “This man was handed over to you by God’s deliberate plan and foreknowledge; and you, with the help of wicked men, put him to death by nailing him to the cross.” (Acts 2:23). Notice who is responsible for the death of Jesus: it accorded with God’s deliberate plan and foreknowledge, but the blame is on the humans who crucified him.

What I want to do here is not to detail all the Bible verses that touch on divine sovereignty and human responsibility. Nor do I want to explore Calvinism or Arminianism in any detail. Instead, I want to lay out three facts that help explain how Christians can live with the idea of predestination.

## 1. You can be a Christian and remain unsure about lots of things.

Becoming a Christian doesn’t mean you suddenly know everything. It means believing that Jesus is lord and saviour and seeking to live by faith in him. There is a lot of space left for questioning about all sorts of things, including predestination.

When you go on an overseas trip, you don’t have to know all the details of how a plane works before you’re confident enough to step on one. You just need to have confidence that the pilot knows what they’re doing.

To be a Christian, you don’t need to understand the mechanics of predestination and human choice, or the trinity, or the inspiration of scripture. You just need to trust that God knows what he’s doing.

Note that we are not talking about having doubts about whether things exist or not. We’re talking about questions about how things work.

You are allowed to remain agnostic about the mechanics of divine sovereignty, free will and human responsibility. You are allowed to have questions about those things, and you are allowed to never reach a complete answer. It might not be intellectually satisfying, but it is somewhat liberating to know that you can live as a Christian without answers to every question.

## 2. Non-Christians struggle with predestination too.

The question of predestination is not just a Christian one; it’s a question philosophers of all stripes have wrestled with for millennia. They might not use the same language that Christians do—*divine sovereignty*, *predestination*, *sin*—but they still talk about determinism, free will, moral responsibility, and all sorts of similar concepts.

Atheists and theists alike debate the nature of human will.

Some philosophers—many atheists among them—believe that everything in the future is already determined by the current physical makeup of our universe. If you could rewind the clock back to the time of the Big Bang and hit play, the universe would unfold exactly as it did the first time, down to the colour of the shirt you picked out this morning. This is called *determinism*.

Some philosophers—many atheists among them—believe human beings can make genuine, free choices. This view is called *libertarianism*.

There are philosophers who think determinism is compatible with meaningful free will, and others who think determinism rules out genuine freedom. These views are called *compatibilism* and *incompatibilism*, respectively.

Within Christianity there is a spectrum of views on the interplay between God’s sovereignty and human responsibility, as there is a spectrum of views about determinism and human responsibility within the world of philosophy.

Being a Christian doesn’t solve the philosophical problem, but this shouldn’t stop someone from having faith, because not being a Christian doesn’t solve the philosophical problem either.

## 3. History contains many examples of Christians who believed in both predestination and human responsibility.

Perhaps the person who talked about predestination most in the Bible was Paul. He had a robust belief in God’s sovereignty in all things, including in choosing who would be saved.

It strikes me as strange that people will sometimes use Paul’s ideas about predestination as a reason not to pray, not to evangelise, and not to take personal responsibility seriously. It’s strange because when you look not just at what Paul says but how Paul lives, you see immediately that these are not the practical conclusions Paul came to. Paul’s belief in God’s sovereignty did not dampen his prayer life or any other aspect of his faith. Instead, it was foundational to all of it.

Paul did not use this belief as an excuse for laziness. Instead, Paul took personal responsibility for his own actions and encouraged others to do the same. He repented, prayed, evangelised and wrote letters encouraging churches to take their lives seriously.

We could list plenty of other examples of people in the Bible who demonstrated a sincere belief in God’s sovereignty and yet took responsibility for their own actions and called on others to do the same. Jesus would be on that list.

When people ask me how it is that Christians can live with predestination, I typically point them to the Bible where we find examples of men and women living by faith in a sovereign God while taking serious responsibility for their own actions.
