The below post was written to flesh out some thoughts ahead of appearing on The Pastor's Heart podcast alongside some other mission pastors to discuss Easter.

## Goals / Outcomes / Hopes

#### Compare to Easter 2025 at SPA:

One big goal is simply to see more people attend than in previous years.

At our 2025 Easter Sunday we had ~1,000 total: ~550 at Morning services (80% adults), ~200 at Mandarin service, ~100 at AC and ~150 at NC.

It was interesting that morning and afternoon service attendance was higher than normal, while night attendance was lower than normal.

One factor that affects our ability to compare last year to this year is the fact that Easter was in the middle weekend of the school holidays last year, and so lots of people were already away on holidays, whereas this year Easter is at the beginning of the school holidays.

#### See 100+ non-Christians explore Christianity at St Pauls' in 2026

Ultimately we want to see more people following Jesus.

Holding a great Easter and Christmas service is not an effective strategy for outreach in and of itself. These services must be seen as pieces of the outreach puzzle.

For non-Christians to discover and follow Jesus, we need to help non-Christians explore the gospel. This happens through Easter and Christmas preaching—absolutely. But we've found it incredibly helpful to have a weekly opportunity for non-Christians and new Christians to explore the gospel. We run our own course, 'Explore Christianity', on Tuesday nights for this purpose.


## Advertising

#### What do we advertise?

'Hook'–y vs. simple. Last year we went with simple: Easter at St Paul's. This year we've gone for a hook: Scary Good News. Possible advantages:
• Ties in thematically with the end of Mark's gospel.
• Cuts through the 'noise' of other advertising, piques interest.

We won't know what works better unless we try both approaches. If we want to get better long-term, we've got to take short term risks to decide what works best.

#### Who do we advertise to?

Mandarin-speakers and English speakers.

Young families.

Not the skeptic, but the open.

#### Where do we advertise?

Advertise on socials – meta ads, local radius.

Not a huge fan of door-knocking and walk-up in our area.

#### How do we advertise?

Videos and images. "What does Easter mean?" + "Scary Good News".

Lead to a dedicated landing page with all the service times.

Advertise 'Explore Christianity' at Easter services.

Maundy Thursday and Good Friday = insider-focus.

Easter Sunday = outsider focus.


## Preaching

Clear, compelling presentation of the gospel.

End of Mark's gospel: the resurrection is scary if it's true—but it is simulateneously good news.

The Easter sermon should not be a dry commentary of a passage—it should resonate with peoples' deep longings and invite them into a new world. It should get people thinking about their own life and the possibility that they are completely lost without God. It should challenge the skeptic and jolt the apathetic.

The call to action is to explore Christianity.

## Extras
