  <h1>Two Types of Teams</h1>
  <p><em>January 2026</em></p>

 <p>I want to paint you a mental picture of two types of teams. Perhaps you've been a part of one of them.</p>

 <p>The first team I'll just call the "high trust" team. When I was eleven years old I was in a high trust team. It was my soccer team, perhaps the best team I've ever been a part of.</p>
 
 <p>The strategy was fairly simple: pass the ball until someone is in position to shoot and score, and don't ever be the one who loses the ball.</p>

 <p>If I had the ball, I would look forward to see if there was anyone free to pass it to. If not, I'd pass it left or right or behind. If I saw a teammate in space, I would not hesitate—I would pass the ball trusting that my teammate would control it and pass it to someone else. Even if they were in a small amount of space, I would still pass it. I trusted that a small amount of space was all they needed.</p>

 <p>It wasn't just me. We all played this way. We trusted everyone could handle the ball. If someone couldn't handle the ball—if they lost it time and time again—we would speak to them at practice. We would let them know they needed to practise, and we would all help them practise what they needed to get better at. We'd tackle the problem head on.</p>

 <p>It was a high trust team, and we won the competition. We worked so hard and it was so fun to be a part of.</p>

 <p>The second team I'll just call the "low trust" team. I can think of a low trust team that almost all of us are a part of every day. It's the team of commuters on the roads in the morning driving side by side trying to get to where we all need to be.</p>

 <p>Everyone knows this is a low trust team. That's why we train people in "defensive driving". Defensive driving means even if we consider ourselves good drivers, we drive with the assumption that other people are bad drivers. We're not supposed to trust that other people know what they're doing. We drive with a constant alertness about what others are doing around us. If there's any doubt, we slow down or stop entirely. If we see someone about to make a mistake, we're already far enough away that it won't affect us.</p>

 <p>Plenty of teams operate in this low trust way. You can't ask people to do something because you can't trust them to do it. People don't ask you to do things because they don't trust you either. Everyone does their own thing, and things move with little speed or coherence. People are wary of their teammates and the mistakes they might make. When mistakes are made, nobody wants to talk about it—they just want to make sure they themselves are protected. Responsibility is never really handed over. No real fun is had. If any progress is made, it's slow and likely accidental. All in all, it's an awful experience.</p>

 <p>In a high trust team, if you ask someone to do something you don't have to remind them to do it.</p>

 <p>In a high trust team, there aren't any teammates who you hesitate giving responsibility to.</p>

 <p>In a high trust team, if someone makes a mistake, you tell them about it, and you expect the same in return.</p>

 <p>In a high trust team, it's very hard to hurt someone's feelings, even if you're telling them about a mistake they've made.</p>

 <p>In a high trust team, everyone knows everyone is working hard to get better at what they do.</p>

 <p>In a high trust team, things move fast because time isn't spent double-checking, hesitating, and postponing. Problems aren't ignored but dealt with quickly.</p>

 <p>In a high trust team, people have more fun and get more things done.</p>

 <p>If you're in a group of people working toward a common goal, strive to be a high trust team.</p>
