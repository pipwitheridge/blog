    <h1>Explore the Apostles' Creed</h1>
    <p><em>February 2026</em></p>

<p>Below is the scaffolding of a 3-week evangelistic course based on the Apostles’ Creed.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="week-1-belief-in-god">Week 1: Belief in God</h1>

<p>• Introductory / get-to-know-you question: have you ever gone on a journey?<br />
• Introduction to exploring: two kinds of maps (large-scale relief map, small-scale; Bible and the Creed) – could include both map types on the screen as an example.
• Course overview (3 week preview)<br />
• Introduction to the Apostles’ Creedx
• Read the Apostles’ Creed<br />
• Focusing in on words “I believe in God” - creed = belief<br />
• “I” is significant; it’s a personal faith, not simply defined by culture or upbringing.
• “Believe” need unpacking. It’s not like saying “I believe in UFOs” or “I believe in democracy”… it’s more like saying “I have faith in my car.”
• ”God” needs unpacking. It’s not any God; it’s a particular God. It’s not an absent God; it’s a loving God. It’s not an impotent God; it’s an omnipotent God. It is not a man-made God; man cannot fully grasp God (nor should we expect to).<br />
• Possible verses to explore about faith/belief: Romans 4, Hebrews 11, Mark 5:25-;34
• Possible verses to explore about God’s character: Exodus 34:6-7
• Weighing up belief in God verses agnosticism and atheism<br />
— traditional arguments against God<br />
— traditional arguments for God<br />
• ”creator of heaven and earth” … Gen 1 &amp; 2, their main aim is to tell us not how the world was made but who made it.
• Apostles’ creed doesn’t give those arguments<br />
• Spiritual claims &amp; historical claims<br />
• Christianity hinges on historical claims<br />
• Jesus’ death and resurrection in history<br />
— Tom Holland Quote<br />
— Biblical Quote (Luke 1:1–4; 1 John 1:1-2)</p>

<h1 id="week-2-father-son-spirit">Week 2: Father, Son, Spirit</h1>

<p>• Introductory / get-to-know-you question: three words to describe yourself
• Course overview<br />
• Read the Apostles’ Creed<br />
• Focusing on 3 words, Father, Son and Spirit
• Father = provider; we are dependant on God for everything, including our existence 
• Jesus prays to his Father and promising that he and his Father would send “another Helper” (John 14:16) 
• Salvation scheme: the Father planning, the Son procuring, and the Spirit applying redemption. See Romans 8:1-17; 2 Corinthians 13:14; Ephesians 1:3-14; 2 Thessalonians 2:13ff.; 1 Peter 1:2. 
• Verses explaining God as Father<br />
• the Father loves the Son (John 3:35; 5:20) and makes him great by giving him glory and great things to do (5:20-30; 10:17ff.; 17:23-26). 
• “To all who did receive him (Jesus), who believed in his name, he gave power to become children of God, who were born… of God” (John 1:12ff.). 
• ”Almighty” - he can and will do all that he intends.<br />
• <em>Whatever the Lord pleases, he does, in heaven and on earth, in the seas and all deeps.</em> Psalm 135:6.<br />
• This doesn’t negate human choices and responsibility.<br />
• Verses showing Jesus as son<br />
• the Son loves the Father (John 14:31) and always does what pleases the Father (8:29)
• Verses showing Spirit as distinct<br />
• Trinity: not three seperate Gods, trinity. And yet, trinity blows our mind.
• Missions of God: The Father send the Son; the Father and the Son sent the Spirit<br />
• The Father made me; the Son saved me; the Spirit changes me<br />
• What this means for Christian living: we can know God the Father, we can change<br />
• Interview: how has life changed since becoming a Christian?<br />
• Other relevant verses for this week: John 1:1–18, “Have we not all one Father? Has not one God created us?” Malachi 2:10</p>
