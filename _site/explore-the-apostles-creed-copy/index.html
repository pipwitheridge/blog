    <h1>Explore the Apostles' Creed</h1>
    <p><em>February 2026</em></p>

<p>Below is the scaffolding of a 3-week evangelistic course based on the Apostles’ Creed.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="week-1-belief-in-god">Week 1: Belief in God</h1>

<p>• Introductory / get-to-know-you question: have you ever gone on a journey?<br />
• Introduction to exploring: two kinds of maps (large-scale relief map, small-scale; Bible and the Creed) – could include both map types on the screen as an example.
• Course overview (3 week preview)<br />
• Introduction to the Apostles’ Creedx
• Read the Apostles’ Creed<br />
• Focusing in on words “I believe in God” - creed = belief<br />
• “I” is significant; it’s a personal faith, not simply defined by culture or upbringing.
• “Believe” need unpacking. It’s not like saying “I believe in UFOs” or “I believe in democracy”… it’s more like saying “I have faith in my car.”
• ”God” needs unpacking. It’s not any God; it’s a particular God. It’s not an absent God; it’s a loving God. It’s not an impotent God; it’s an omnipotent God.
• Possible verses to explore about faith/belief: Romans 4, Hebrews 11, Mark 5:25-;34
• Possible verses to explore about God’s character: Exodus 34:6-7
• Weighing up belief in God verses agnosticism and atheism<br />
— traditional arguments against God<br />
— traditional arguments for God<br />
• Apostles’ creed doesn’t give those arguments<br />
• Spiritual claims &amp; historical claims<br />
• Christianity hinges on historical claims<br />
• Jesus’ death and resurrection in history<br />
— Tom Holland Quote<br />
— Biblical Quote (Luke 1:1–4; 1 John 1:1-2)</p>

<p>• Introductory / get-to-know-you question<br />

• Read the Apostles’ Creed<br />
• Focusing on 3 words, Father, Son and Spirit<br />
• Jesus prays to his Father and promising that he and his Father would send “another Helper” (John 14:16)

• Verses explaining God as Father<br />
• Verses showing Jesus as son<br />

• What this means for Christian living: we can know God the Father, we can change<br />
