    <h1>The Challenge of Mark 8–16 for Young Adults</h1>
    <p><em>January 2026</em></p>

<p>In the first half of Mark’s gospel, the central question driving the entire narrative is “who is this man?” In Mark 8, Peter answers that question: “You are the Messiah.” The rest of the gospel is about finding out what it means that Jesus is the Messiah.</p>

<p>Here I want to outline some key passages and cutting questions that may be useful for young adults studying the second half of Mark’s gospel.</p>

<h4 id="mark-101331">Mark 10:13–31</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The rich man wants Jesus without letting go of his riches. What is something you struggle to let go of to follow Jesus?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What do we gain in this present age by following Jesus, according to verses 29–30?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How does our culture measure a person’s worth in their twenties? How does this compare to how Jesus measures a person’s worth?</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="mark-1032-52">Mark 10.32-52</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>What would your life in your late teens and early twenties need to look like for the people around you at work/uni to consider your life to be “great”?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Imagine you tried to become a “servant of all” for one year. What would that look like? What about your life would change?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What practical steps can you take in your life now to become great (as defined by Jesus)?</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="mark-111-1212">Mark 11.1-12.12</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>What does it mean to be productive in young adulthood?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the product, or the fruits, that Jesus wants from you in your life at the moment? Are any of these fruits lacking in your life?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do you have a prayer life? If not, what is stopping you? If yes, what threatens to stop it?</p>
  </li>
</ol>
