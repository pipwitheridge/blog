    <h1>Mark 11:1–12:12</h1>
    <p><em>March 2026</em></p>

<p>Below are notes for a sermon of mine on Mark 11:1–12:12.</p>

<hr />

<p>11.1–7. This ties to a prophecy, “your king is coming to you; righteous and having salvation is he, humble and mounted on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.” (Zechariah 9:9). It’s possible we get the image here wrong much of the time. We think the donkey is what makes him lowly; we imagine him riding Eeyore from Winnie the Pooh or Donkey from Shrek. In reality, the donkey is a symbol of strength. The rich had donkeys (Judges 5:10), King David rode a donkey (2 Sam 13:29), Solomon rides a donkey to his anointing as king (1 Kings 1:33). Jesus is aligning himself with these exalted kings as he rides into Jeruslem. A horse represents going to battle; a donkey represents having won the battle. The shock of Zechariah 9:9 is that this king would be “lowly”. Jesus has the crowds buzzing for him—in what sense is he lowly? He’s lowly because though he rides into Jerusalm on the back of a donkey, he knows that in a few days time he’ll be walked out of Jerusalem with a cross on his back.</p>

<p>It is perhaps worth reading Zech 9:9–13:<br />
9 Rejoice greatly, Daughter Zion!
    Shout, Daughter Jerusalem!
See, your king comes to you,
    righteous and victorious,
lowly and riding on a donkey,
    on a colt, the foal of a donkey.
10 I will take away the chariots from Ephraim
    and the warhorses from Jerusalem,
    and the battle bow will be broken.
He will proclaim peace to the nations.
    His rule will extend from sea to sea
    and from the River to the ends of the earth.
11 As for you, because of the blood of my covenant with you,
    I will free your prisoners from the waterless pit.
12 Return to your fortress, you prisoners of hope;
    even now I announce that I will restore twice as much to you.
13 I will bend Judah as I bend my bow
    and fill it with Ephraim.
I will rouse your sons, Zion,
    against your sons, Greece,
    and make you like a warrior’s sword.</p>

<p>11.8-10. This is a beautiful scene until one realises what is to follow. The same lips that praise Jesus later shout “Crucify him! Crucify him!”</p>

<p>11.12–20. Nothing about Mark’s gospel is lazy or unintentional. The way Mark pieces the narrative together is important. We see this in the story of the blind man whose vision becomes blury before it becomes clear, right before Peter’s spiritual vision goes from dark to blury in his acknowledgement of Jesus as Messiah; clarity was yet to come. In this section, the fig tree doesn’t bear the fruit Jesus wanted it to, and so it was accursed; the temple was not bearing the fruit God wanted it to, and so it would be accursed; we see this continuation in chapter 13.</p>

<p>11.15–17. Turning worship into a money-making scheme is evil, and the watching world knows it. There are many online who turn the church into a business to sell a product.</p>

<p>11.22–25. Faith will be rewarded, whether in the temple or not.</p>

<p>11.30. Question: when it says “John’s Baptism”, is it talking about the baptism John gave Jesus, or the baptism John gave everyone, or the baptism John himself received?</p>

<p>11.32. “They feared the people” is perhaps the perfect way to describe everything wrong about the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders.</p>

<p>12.1-5. Like the story of the fig tree, proper “fruit” is what’s on view here. In the Old Testament, the people did not produce the fruit of righteousness in response to the prophets sent by God, instead they harmed them. They will do the same to Jesus.</p>

<p>12.12. Similarly to 11.32, the key characteristic to be aware of here is their fear of the people: “they were afraid of the crowd”.</p>
