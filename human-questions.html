  <h1>Human Questions</h1>
  <p><em>October 2025</em></p>

  <p>There are certain questions only humans ask, and there is something puzzling about a person who lives unruffled by them. Cats and dogs don’t ask these questions, as far as I can tell. They are the questions that look backward, forward, inward, and outward.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Where did everything come from?</strong></em> is a question that looks backward, which seems a uniquely human thing to do. We’ve asked this question since we could ask it, and we are yet to come up with a complete answer.</p>

  <p>One answer is that everything came from nowhere. The idea is that the universe has always existed; we are one small part of an equation of mass and energy that has always balanced out. We did not come from anywhere; the stuff that makes us up has always been here. The universe is one giant Melchizedek, without beginning, without end.</p>

  <p>Of course, the problem with this answer is the law of cause and effect: for everything that happens, something made it happen. What made the universe happen?</p>

  <p>This leads us to an impossible fork in the road where we must choose between an infinite number of causes stretching back forever, or an infinite cause, a prime mover. It seems neither choice is completely sound, but it also seems they are the only two possible options. In other words, the truth of it all, whatever it is, must be shocking.</p>

  <p>Why does neither seem sound? Again—an infinite number of causes doesn’t sit well because it implies no beginning, no root cause for the universe. An infinite cause, a prime mover, doesn’t sit well because we are left puzzling over what caused that prime mover to exist. Theologians confront this problem every time a child asks, “then who created God?”. That doesn’t let naturalists off the hook, of course. The one who sees the universe itself as the prime mover is left puzzling the same question.</p>

  <p>The naturalist says the simplest answer is the best, and so discards any notion of an unnatural, or supernatural, entity; all things being equal, why introduce God into the equation? I’ve always been suspicious of this reasoning. After all, if we know the truth of it all is counter-intuitive, why resort to its most intuitive version? If we know the answer breaks our logic, why lean on logic’s maxims?</p>

  <p><em><strong>Where does everything go?</strong></em> is a question that invites us to look forward, which seems a uniquely human exercise. Applied personally it means: where do I go when I die? Applied universally it means: where is the universe headed in the long run? Again, we have no complete answer.</p>

  <p>One answer is, again, nowhere. We dissolve, disintegrate. The universe goes on, changing forever but never really changing. We absorb into Earth’s ecosystem, Earth absorbs into the solar system, the solar system absorbs into space, which absorbs everything forever, producing all sorts of new things made from old things.</p>

  <p>It’s not a bad answer. After all, our planet seems to operate this way. Things come into existence and then go out of existence, over and over and over. Things don’t come back, but their stuff lives on in other things. Our planet is a mass that came from other mass which came from other mass. It is fair to say we are headed nowhere if everything goes on like that forever. But what if it doesn’t?</p>

  <p>Another answer is that we are translated into something else or transported elsewhere. The individual lives on in some sense. The universe takes a new turn. The Christian hopes in the resurrection of their body and the renewal of the cosmos, not knowing how or when.</p>

  <p>Both answers depend on faith, not sight. You need faith to adopt any view about the future. Each faith has its reasons. The naturalist who thinks the universe is going nowhere points back at the way things have always seemed. The Christian who expects life after death points back to the resurrection of Christ. To the extent that Christ’s resurrection is tenable, so is their expectation.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Why am I here?</strong></em> is a question that directs us inward. It haunts some and energises others. If we come from nothing and are going nowhere, the answer must be about the here and now. That’s well enough for some; for others, it’s barely enough. We work and rest and play and hope it all matters. Fleeting moments come when we’re not so sure. These moments are not so fleeting for some, and the wrestle for meaning beats them down till they’re out.</p>

  <p>Mankind has well documented our search for meaning. We write about what to care about, what not to care about, where to invest time, what motivations are most noble, how to cultivate interests, how to let go, how to hold on. In recent times some cultural commentators have not so much prescribed where our meaning should come from—they’ve described where it has come from. They point out that today’s Western values came from millennia of Christian thought and practice. To deny Christianity’s relevance in the modern world is to ignore the cultural debt we owe Christianity itself—so the argument goes. Cultural debt apologetics helps explain how we in the West got where we are, but it doesn’t answer the question of why we are here.</p>

  <p>What is our purpose? Christians and believers of all stripes rephrase the question as “why did God make me?” and seek its answer to the extent God reveals it. Others see life as a journey whose early steps are about finding purpose, and whose main quest is to live it out. Purpose doesn’t need to be grand or anchored in some common truth; it just needs to get you out of bed in the morning. People collect plush toys, or compete in coding competitions, or earn more money than last year, or have a family, or learn all there is to learn about French cinema, or build their body at the gym, or chase their impulses, or hunt some higher sense of wellbeing. Again—whatever gets you out of bed in the morning.</p>

  <p><em><strong>What’s out there?</strong></em> is a question we ask when we look outwards, when we gaze at the night sky and contemplate the magnitude of what it hides. Does the universe have bounds, and if so, what’s outside them? What’s outside the cave, over the mountain, on the moon—and can we get there?</p>

  <p>We have made progress with this question. We’ve gone places our ancestors thought unsearchable. We’ve seen things nobody has seen before. Of course, we’ve just scratched the surface. Most of the universe is still left to search, and it’s hard to see how we’ll do it. But we’ll certainly try.</p>

  <p>Some hope that by answering this question, we’ll answer all the others.</p>
