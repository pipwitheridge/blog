  <h1>The Challenge of Mark 8–16 for Young Adults</h1>
  <p><em>January 2026</em></p>

 <p>In the first half of Mark's gospel, the central question driving the entire narrative is "who is this man?" In Mark 8, Peter answers that question: "You are the Messiah." The rest of the gospel is about finding out what it means that Jesus is the Messiah.</p>

 <p>Here I want to outline some key passages and cutting questions that may be useful for young adults studying the second half of Mark's gospel.</p>

 <h4>Mark 10:13-31</h4>

<p>1. The rich man wants Jesus without letting go of his riches. What is something you struggle to let go of to follow Jesus?</p>

<p>2. What do we gain in this present age by following Jesus, according to verses 29–30?</p>

<p>3. How does our culture measure a person's worth in their twenties? How does this compare to how Jesus measures a person's worth?</p>

 <h4>Mark 10:13–52</h4>

<p>1. How does our society measure a person's worth at a) work, b) uni, c) online? How does this compare to how Jesus measures a person's worth?</p>

<p>2. The rich man wants Jesus without letting go. What are some things people your age commonly struggle to release control over?</p>

<p>3. Bartimaeus knows what he wants and asks boldly. What might it look like for you to be honest with Jesus about what you really want right now?</p>

<h4>Mark 11:1–12:12</h4>

<p>1. If Jesus walked into your life like he walks into Jerusalem — what “tables” would he flip first?</p>
<p><em>Be specific: what patterns, priorities, spending, relationships, habits, or ambitions would he call out as performative religion / hollow success?</em></p>

<p>2. If Jesus walked into your our church like he walks into Jerusalem — what “tables” would he flip first?</p>

<p>3. In the parable of the tenants, they want the vineyard without the owner. Where do you want the benefits of God (meaning, comfort, moral order, community) without God having authority?</p>


<h4>Mark 12:13–40</h4>

<p>1. Why do political, cultural, or ethical debates feel so emotionally charged right now?</p>

<p>2. Put yourself in the shoes of a friend or family member who doesn't believe in the resurrection. If there is no resurrection, what do you think gives life long-term meaning?</p>

<p>3a. Take 10 minutes and write down in list-form everything you've done in the past 24 hours. Once this is done, put a mark next to all the things you think you did that were not motivated by love of God or love of neighbour.</p>

<p>3b. Loving God and neighbour sounds ideal, but it's hard. Are there obvious opportunities to love God or neighbour that you're not currently taking?</p>

<h4>Mark 13</h4>

<p>1. What uncertainties cause the most anxiety for young adults right now — career, housing, relationships, global instability?</p>

<p>2. How do people try to manage uncertainty today — productivity, planning, self-improvement, distractions?</p>

<p>3. What’s the difference between being alert about the future and being consumed by it?</p>

<p>4. What secular hopes exist for the future? How do these compare to gospel hope?</p>

<h4>Mark 14:1-6</h4>

<p>The woman’s act looks excessive. What kinds of commitments would our culture label as “too much”?</p>

<p>Why do people often admire radical commitment in theory but resist it personally?</p>

<p>Judas stays close to Jesus while drifting internally. What might quiet disengagement from faith look like today?</p>

<p>Is sacrificial love ultimately sustainable — or does it always get exploited?</p>

<h4>Mark 14:27-72</h4>

<p>Where do you feel pressure to present a confident, together version of yourself — even when it’s not true?</p>

<p>Peter’s failure happens under social pressure. Where are you most tempted to stay quiet about your beliefs or values?</p>

<p>If Christianity is true, why are its key leaders so flawed?</p>

<h4>Mark 14:27-72</h4>

<p>Spend 10 minutes alone writing down what Jesus' death means for you personally. Share these with others.</p>

<p>Spend 10 minutes alone writing down what Jesus' resurrection means for you personally. Share these with others.</p>

<p>How has the gospel transformed your life? Share one specific thing.</p>
